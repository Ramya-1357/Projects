Sales History Database Design Project 

Project Description: 

In this project, you need to design a database system for a given domain mentioned above. For this, first you need to conduct research about the domain itself and collect data requirements (such as information about the main components of the system, how the system works, how different entities interact with each other etc.) Then you will try to design a system as practical as possible. This means, assumptions you make should comply well with real-world situations/scenarios.  

Requirements 

The sample company does a high volume of business, so it runs business statistics reports to aid in decision making. Many of these reports are time-based and nonvolatile. That is, they analyze past data trends. The company loads data into its data warehouse regularly to gather statistics for these reports. These reports include annual, quarterly, monthly, and weekly sales figures by product. These reports are stored with the help of schema Sales History (SH). 

The company also runs reports on distribution channels through which its sales are delivered. When the company runs special promotions on its products, it analyzes the impact of the promotions on sales. It also analyzes sales by geographical area. 

 

Tasks: 

Step 1: Write the data requirements for the system. 

Step 2: Draw the initial ER diagram for your system. ER diagrams should be drawn electronically. You can use any chart-drawing tool of your choice. (i.e., draw.io, lucidchart.com, etc.) 

A minimal system design should include at least:  
a. two one-to-one binary relationships. 
 b. two one-to-many binary relationships. 
 c. two many-to-many binary relationships. 
  
You can create more relationships if required. 

Step 3: Map the ER diagram into relational schema. Show the resulting relational schema: show your tables, primary keys and foreign keys. 

Step 4: Discuss database normalization rules on your tables. Show the functional dependencies that violate 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal forms. Normalize your table(s) into 3NF. 

Step 5: Show the final relational schema after normalization. 

Step 6: Create tables using appropriate SQL command. Make sure to include primary key and foreign key definitions and triggered actions on foreign keys. Decide also about NOT NULL constraints and DEFAULT values for the attributes.  

Step 7: PL/SQL: Create all stored procedures and trigger.
